# Social Media API

## Description
This is a social media API that allows users to share their thoughts, create and add people to their freinds list, and react to what their friends are doing. It is back-end only so you'll have to go through a lengthy install process.

## Table of Contents


## Installation
Copy the SSH key from the Repo into a folder on your own computer. Once this is done and you've opened the files in your own workspace, make sure to npm i the necessary files. Next, change the MongoDB connection URL. Then, open the terminal and run 'node index.js'. Finally, head on over to insomnia to get, post, update, and delete requests at will. This can go for thoughts, reactions, and even friends. Enjoy!

## Usage
Once the files are installed, open the folder in your personal workspace
